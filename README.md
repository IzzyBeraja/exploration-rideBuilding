# exploration-rideBuilding
A simple exploration of building objects that follow lines and curves while undergoing forces

## Goals
The main goal of this project is to see how I can create rigid bodies that follow paths and curves

I want to learn:
- [ ] How to build rigid bodies in Unreal Engine
- [ ] How to force rigid bodies to follow paths
- [ ] How to build paths with bezier curves
- [ ] How to save paths and rigid bodies for future use
